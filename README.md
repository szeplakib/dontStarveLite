# dontStarveLite2020
dontStarveLite is a sample game, and hobby project, originaly a home project for School.

The whole project is written in Java, the only library used is Javafx, which was part of Java 8. Since I wanted to learn a project management tool, I left Java 8 in favor of Java 11, and managed it's openJFX dependency with Maven.
